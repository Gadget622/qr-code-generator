# Project Issues: Link Extractor and QR Code Generator

This document tracks known issues, challenges, and potential improvements for the Link Extractor and QR Code Generator project.

## Known Issues

### QR Code Duplication
When multiple YouTube links were put into the QR code generator, one of the links was duplicated multiple times. This should not occur. Weirdly, this problem was not present with the google docs links that it was tested on.
- A fix for this would likely involve a redesign of the batch processing system. 
- A CSV containing only unique URLs, the version, and the binary would be extremely helpful for ensuring everything is processed correctly. 
- All of the data would be kept in a master CSV and all images and outputs would be generated after in a fashion similar to to how it is currently presented.
- A separate module for every part of the process would be necessary. One module for PDF generation, one module for PPT generation, another for QRCode generation, data handling, etc. The code should be analyzed in a lot of detail so that its processes and shortcomings are well-understood so they can be fixed and properly aligned with what the app is supposed to do.

### Link Extraction

1. **Complex URL Patterns**
   - **Description**: The current regex pattern may miss some valid URLs with complex structures.
   - **Impact**: Some links might not be extracted from input files.
   - **Potential Solution**: Enhance regex pattern or consider using a specialized URL extraction library.
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Encoded URLs**
   - **Description**: URLs that are URL-encoded or otherwise obfuscated might not be properly detected.
   - **Impact**: Links using special encoding might be missed or incorrectly processed.
   - **Potential Solution**: Add support for common URL encoding patterns and normalization.
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **Context-Dependent Links**
   - **Description**: Some files may contain relative links that require context to form complete URLs.
   - **Impact**: Relative links might result in invalid QR codes.
   - **Potential Solution**: Implement context-aware link processing with base URL configuration.
   - **Priority**: Medium

### File Processing

1. **Large File Handling**
   - **Description**: Processing very large files may lead to memory issues.
   - **Impact**: Application might crash or become unresponsive with large inputs.
   - **Potential Solution**: Implement streaming processing for large files.
   - **Priority**: High

2. **Character Encoding**
   - **Description**: Files with non-standard encodings might not be processed correctly.
   - **Impact**: Links might be missed or corrupted during extraction.
   - **Potential Solution**: Enhance encoding detection and support multiple encodings.
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **PDF Extraction Limitations**
   - **Description**: The current PDF extraction might miss links in complex PDF layouts.
   - **Impact**: Some links in PDFs might not be detected.
   - **Potential Solution**: Consider using a more advanced PDF processing library.
   - **Priority**: Medium

### Output Generation

1. **PowerPoint Compatibility**
   - **Description**: PowerPoint files generated might have compatibility issues with some versions of Microsoft Office.
   - **Impact**: Generated presentations might not display correctly in all environments.
   - **Potential Solution**: Test with various versions and implement compatibility modes.
   - **Priority**: Low

2. **QR Code Size Optimization**
   - **Description**: QR codes for very long URLs might be too dense and difficult to scan.
   - **Impact**: Some QR codes might not be reliably scannable.
   - **Potential Solution**: Implement URL shortening option or automatic adjustment of QR parameters.
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Directory Path Length Limitations**
   - **Description**: Very long URLs might create directory paths exceeding system limitations.
   - **Impact**: File creation might fail for some links.
   - **Potential Solution**: Implement more aggressive path shortening algorithms.
   - **Priority**: High

## Technical Challenges

1. **Dependencies Management**
   - **Description**: The project relies on multiple optional dependencies that might not be available in all environments.
   - **Impact**: Some features might not work depending on the installation environment.
   - **Potential Solution**: Improve dependency checking and user feedback about missing features.
   - **Priority**: Medium

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
   - **Description**: Path handling and certain operations might differ between operating systems.
   - **Impact**: Application might behave differently on different platforms.
   - **Potential Solution**: Use platform-agnostic path handling and test on multiple platforms.
   - **Priority**: Medium

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Description**: Processing many links or large files might be slow.
   - **Impact**: User experience might be affected by long processing times.
   - **Potential Solution**: Implement parallel processing and optimize critical code paths.
   - **Priority**: Medium

## Feature Requests

1. **Link Validation**
   - **Description**: Validate extracted links before generating QR codes.
   - **Benefit**: Avoid creating QR codes for broken or invalid links.
   - **Complexity**: Medium
   - **Priority**: High

2. **Custom QR Code Styling**
   - **Description**: Allow users to customize QR code appearance (colors, shapes, embedded logos).
   - **Benefit**: Enable branding and visual customization.
   - **Complexity**: High
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **Batch Processing**
   - **Description**: Process multiple input files at once.
   - **Benefit**: Improve efficiency for users with many files to process.
   - **Complexity**: Low

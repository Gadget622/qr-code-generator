Key improvements and explanations:

1.  **Error Handling:** The `try...except` block now catches potential exceptions during QR code generation, providing more robust error handling.
2.  **Binary Data Storage:** The code now correctly retrieves the QR code's matrix data and converts it into a binary string. It also adds the original link and the version information to the beginning of the file. This allows for more complete data recovery if needed.
3.  **Clearer Output:** The print statements now provide more informative messages about the saved files.
4.  **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** This ensures that the `input()` and `generate_qr_code()` calls only execute when the script is run directly, not when imported as a module.
5.  **Data File Content:** The data file now contains the original link and qr version at the beginning of the file, then the binary string of the matrix. These are encoded as utf-8.
6.  **Version Determination:** The `version=None` now allows the QR code library to determine the best QR code version automatically.
7.  **File Writing Mode:** The binary data file is now written in binary mode ("wb") to handle the binary string correctly.
8.  **PIL dependency:** The code now uses the `PIL` library to save the image. This is a common and reliable way to handle image saving in Python. Be sure to install it using `pip install Pillow`.
9. **Efficiency:** The binary data string is generated using string concatenation, which is generally efficient for relatively small QR codes.

To run this code:

1.  **Install the necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install qrcode Pillow
    ```
2.  **Save the code:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `qr_generator.py`).
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python qr_generator.py
    ```
4.  **Enter the link:** The script will prompt you to enter the link.
5.  **Output:** The script will generate a `qrcode.png` image and a `qrcode.bin` data file in the same directory.
